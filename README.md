# Pong-assignment
This is my pong assignment from the Python course at Coursera from Rice University. 
I added a color change of the paddles when they are hit by the ball and I limited the amount of plays to 3 (the player with 3 winning games, wins the game). 

If you are struckling with the Pong assignment, please look carefully at the code so you understand it.
Do not copy and paste my code.
